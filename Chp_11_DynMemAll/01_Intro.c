Dynamic Memory Allocation:
It is a way to allocate memory to a data structure during the runtime.

We need some functions to allocate & free memory dynamically.

Functions in use:
a. Malloc():  memory allocation
b. calloc():    continous allocation
c. free():  free function
d. realloc(): re allocation
