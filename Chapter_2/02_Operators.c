/*
Relational operators: are as follows

==          -- a==b we are questioning whether a is equal to b.
>,>=        -- similar like maths
<,<=        -- similar like maths
!=          -- not equal to
O/p is 1 then it is true and if 0 then it is false
*/


/*
Logical Operators:are as follows

&&-- AND     for true both st must be true
||-- OR      any one of them is true then op is true
! -- NOT     true op false, false op true
they have priority also-- check notes for priority
*/

/*
Assignment operators:
=,
+=      a=a+b --- a+=b
-=      same as above 
*=      same as above 
/=      same as above 
%=      same as above
