/* Instructions: these are statements in a program 
 Types: 1.Types Declaration Instructions-- declare var before using it

        2.Airthmetic Instructions       -- Mathematical operation,single var on the LHS,
        also for a^b we use pow(a,b), also we have to include the header #include <math.h> before using pow(),
        modular operator(%) gives the rem but not applicable for float values.

        Operator Precedence:    (*,/,%)---(+,-)---(=)
                                In the same precendence we go from left to right operating using given operators



        3.Control Instructions:          -- used to determine flow of program
           Types:
           a. Sequence control
           b. Decision control
           c. Loop control
           d. Case control
